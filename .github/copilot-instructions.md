Tria Assignment
Objective
The goal of this assignment is to assess your frontend development skills,
particularly with React, your ability to interact with APIs, your understanding of
component design, and your product sense in translating requirements into a
working application. You will be building a simplified contact list, it should have following
features
1. View the list of contacts
2. Search contact by name by passing name of contact in search bar
3. Ability to add a new contact in the list (Optional)
Details
Core Task:
Build a single-page web application using React that implements the Contact List page
Technical Requirements:
1. Framework: You must use React.
2. Auxiliary Libraries: You are free to use other libraries or meta-frameworks as
you see fit.
3. API Interaction: You can mimic the data fetching from a API or hardcode on the UI
4. Environment: Assume a modern web browser environment.
Design Guidance:
You can be creative on the design for this task and demonstrate UX design
Skills
Submission
1. Deployment: Deploy your application using Vercel (preferred, free with a
GitHub account) or a similar platform (Netlify, GitHub Pages) with a public
accessible URL.
2. Source Code: Provide a link to your source code repository (e.g., GitHub,
GitLab). Ensure the repository is public or grant access.
3. README: Include a README.md file in your repository. You can write notable
features/instructions for your app, like Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally. A
link to the deployed application. Any assumptions you made or design choices you want to
highlight. Brief notes on any libraries you chose to use and why.
Handling Ambiguity
This description intentionally leaves details open to interpretation (e.g.,
specific UI interactions, functionality, error handling details, loading states etc).
Use your product and engineering judgment to make sensible decisions. Please
document any significant assumptions you make in your project's README file.

"""


for this assignment, they are strict with ai usage, so i don't want ai use to be detected, so please do follow these things:
use camelcase like professional js developers use
function based implementation, not class based.
clean code which looks like human written, and no extra things which make the code long(as humans write short code generally).
no comments at all.
use daisyui, light theme.
use vite.
we will deploy using vercel, so keep that in mind, do whole assignment keeping that in mind.

don't write any code as of now, tell me what you have understood, we will also do the optional part. NO code as of now, just tell me what will you do
